# 21 Points (Blackjack style)

## Objective

Start with two D10 dice and follow blackjack rules in an attempt
to get as close to 21 without going bust.

Anyone who busts loses the round.
If nobody busts, the lowest score loses the round.

## Special Rules

- Rolling a 1 - 10 or 10 - 1 is a blackjack, giving one a free clear, gaining an extra life.
- Rolling 5 dice without busting gives you a free pass.
- Rolling 6 - 9 exactly in this order allows you to make someone lose a life. Round still continues.
- Rolling a pair gives you the choice to clear for the round.
- Rolling a triple makes you the winner of the round and everyone else loses a life.

## Commands

```
Starting roll:     /dice 2d10
Subsequent rolls:  /dice 10
```
