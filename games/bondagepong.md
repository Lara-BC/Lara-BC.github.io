# Bondage Pong

In the game,
two teams are formed at opposite ends of the table,
with a number of cups at each end.
Each team takes turns trying to throw a ping pong ball into a cup at the opposite end if the table.
This is accomplished by rolling a die,
and having the number that comes up be the cup the ball landed in.

When you get a ball into a cup,
the cup is removed and the opposing team gets stripped or gets a layer of bondage,
as determined by Ahri.

If a cup is removed, then rolling the number that represents that cup again results in a miss.
The game ends when one side has no more cups.

```note
**To simplify:** Two teams take turns rolling a die until they win by rolling each number on the die at least once.
```

The team that wins gets a wish granted by Ahri.
