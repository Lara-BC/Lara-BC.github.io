# What's Next

"What's Next" is a game made up of rounds,
where in each round a mini-game is picked and played out based on the roll of a D4 or whatever Ahri decides.

Each round, whoever loses either gets stripped, or gets a layer of bondage, as determined by Ahri.
You are out of the game when you have enough bondage, as determined by Ahri.
The last person standing, or whoever is least tied up when the game ends, gets a Wish granted by Ahri.
Everyone else has to obey an unusual order from Ahri.

The different games available are as follows:

## 1 - Quiz

Ahri asks a question and the first person to get it right wins the round.
Everyone else loses.
If the answer you give ends with a question mark,
it is not considered a valid answer.

## 2 - Dice

Everyone rolls a die, usually a D5,
and everyone loses unless they rolled a number someone else has also rolled.

## 3 - Taboo

Ahri whispers one person a character, and a list of words they're not allowed to say.
That person then has to describe the character and get someone else to guess the character correctly in order to win.

```note
You cannot use words contained in taboo words
(e.g. if "superman" is taboo, then you cannot use the word "super").
```

No penalty for wrong guesses.
The person to make the correct guess first also wins.
Guesses with question marks at the end are not valid.
If no one guesses correctly, then the person trying to describe the character loses.

## 4 - Cosplay

Everyone dresses up as a character provided by Ahri, and is then Judged by Ahri.

The winner is whoever Ahri chooses as having done the best at dressing up as the character.
Bondage items are removed temporarily for the round.

This game is removed from the list of possible games once someone ends up with too much bondage,
usually once the torso slot is filled.
