# Cursed Dice

## Rules

Each player is assigned a numeric value based on their position.
So the top left player would be #1 and in a full room,
the bottom right would be #10.

Starting with Player #1, roll a dice with `n + 2` sides,
where `n` is the number of players.

If the dice roll corresponds to a player other than the roller,
that person loves a life (loses clothing or gains a restraint).

If you roll your own number, you may apply the curse to an individual.
A cursed individual will lose twice the number of lives when their number is rolled.
Only one curse may exist at any time.

There are then two extra numbers, that have the following effects:

```
n + 1 => Gain a life (and the remove a restraints or gain clothing)
n + 2 => Alter vibrators settings on any one item
```

```note
Vibrator speeds must only move one step at a time, in either direction.

Gained lives cannot exceed the starting amount (i.e. fully clothed)
```

If at any point someone orgasms, they take a punishment.
(This is doubled if cursed)

The last person standing,
or whoever is least tied up when the game ends,
gets a Wish granted by Ahri.
Everyone else has to obey an unusual order from Ahri.

```note
Mistress Ahri has the right to add any extra dice rolls as desired.
```

## Sudden Death

When only two people remain,
the ability to heal shall be removed from the game.

## Extra

Rolling the value of an eliminated player simply results in a re-roll.
It may be useful to shrink the size of the dice as players are eliminated.
